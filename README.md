There are two Jupyter notebooks in this repository:  CloudZero_Scrapalyze and Anomaly_Detection.

The "Scrapalyzer" as its name implies, scrapes web content and analyzes the sentiment of that content.

The Anomaly Detector uses the Python version of Twitter's Anomaly Detection R package to detect anomalous readings in time series data.

The requirements for each package are listed in their respectively-named text files.

Additionally, there are non-notebook version of these scripts available for use if desired.
